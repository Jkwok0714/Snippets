In cmd:

  bcc32 = Runs compiler
  cd Dektop = Goes to desktop directory
  cd CCoding = Goes into the C coding folder
  bcc32 Lol.cpp = Compiles "Lol.cpp" in the above folder.
  Lol = Runs "Lol.cpp"

YESS!!!!!!!!! I GOT IT!By alias4399, Jul 21, 2006 05:02 AM
    YAHOO!!! I GOT IT WORKING!! :D !

    Well, here is what i did/figured out with the help of everyone's contributions:
    First, you must install OpenAL DevPak through Dev-Cpp (or from the old.devpak website) using the instructions above (^).
    Note: I only got it to work with Visual Studio, not Dev-Cpp, for reasons outlined below.

    You need the following files:

    openAL32.lib OR libOpenAL32.a
    openGL32.lib OR libOpenGL32.a

    OpenAL32.dll
    OpenGL32.dll (usually have it already)

    al.h
    alc.h
    alctypes.h
    altypes.h
    alu.h
    alut.h
    aluttypes.h
    alutypes.h

    aLc.a
    aLu.a
    aLut.a

    * You Don't Need To Install the OpenAL SDK, it will probably confuse you more :( * (the OpenAL32.dll file that comes with the SDK does not work as well as the one that comes with the OpenAL devpak!)

    Go into the OpenAL -0.099-mingw\lib directory and copy OpenAL32.dll to your systemroot directory (type %systemroot% into an explorer window, or its something like WINNT\system32 or WINDOWS\system32 depending on your PC)

    Now, copy the remainder of the files into your \lib directory for your compiler (for visual studio its something like C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc7\PlatformSDK\lib and for Dev-Cpp its (default) C:\Dev-Cpp\lib (like i said, i havent got it to work with dev-c++ yet).

    Now browse to the OpenAL -0.099-mingw\include directory and copy the AL file you see there to your include directory (for VS its C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc7\PlatformSDK\include).

    Your almost there!

    Now, add the following to your linker command line: ALut.a libOpenAL32.a ALu.a ALc.a Libwinmm.a libOpenGL32.a (Dev-Cpp, or OpenGL32.lib for VC).
    That should do it! Though there are a few points i should mention:
    ) This fix only seems to work for VC, i think i have traced the problem to libOpenGL32.a that comes with Dev-Cpp, as i did everything except used the one that comes with VC in VC and it worked fine! Then, i thought, if it works in VC, why not in Dev-Cpp ? So I copied it to dev-cpp\lib dir and tried it ... it didn't work.. so unfortunately at the moment i haven't found a fix for dev-cpp. As soon as i do (hopefully!) i will post it here.

    Thanks for your contribution which really helped me solve the problem.

    Happy Gaming! (And using the book!!)

    Follow-up...By alias4399, Jul 21, 2006 05:14 AM
        Sorry i forgot to post it before, when i tried to use LW2D with VC, it gave me a few extra errors that with Dev-C++ .. I delved into the source and tweaked it a little, which got rid of the errors and hopefully left the engine intact! To download my edited version of LW2D, (credit to the author for the original), go to http://www.freewebs.com/thinkserver/LW2D.zip

        (Btw, to add commands to the linker command line in VC, right click on the project name, click project options, go to C++ -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependecies (i think) and write in your additional files. It doesn't matter whether they are .lib or .a, just write the files for eg:
        libnumberone.a numbertwo.lib

        If you have any more problems, feel free to contact me at:

        Thanks!




GOT IT WORKING WITH Dev-C++By al.bastien, Oct 21, 2006 11:40 PM
    You won't believe this!!!
    It was the order of the compiles or the order of the obj files in the link step.

    It happens when you build your own project from scratch as you are told to do in the book. That puts the LlamaWorks2D files in alphabetic order. This somehow corrupts the EXE.

    To summarize:
    Use the Errata page to add the appropriate libraries to the DEV file that is on the CD. Do not build your own project file (DEV file).

    Tweaking RequiredBy al.bastien, Oct 21, 2006 11:52 PM
        By the way: You will need to tweak the dev file:
        1. The LlamaWorks2D files are included from ..\..\LlamaWorks2D. Change the dev file or move your files.
        2. The linker parameters are wrong use Errata.
        3. The "Do not use standard system startup files or libraries" needs to be changed from Yes to No. Project Options, Compiler Page, Linker options.

        Do this and you should be good to go!
